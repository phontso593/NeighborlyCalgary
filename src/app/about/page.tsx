        Neighbourly is a community-driven platform designed to connect people through acts of giving and receiving. Our mission is to foster stronger, more supportive neighborhoods by making it easy for individuals to donate items they no longer need and for others to request things that can make their lives a little easier.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Whether it's clothes, books, furniture, or toys, your unused items can find a new home and bring joy to someone in your community. Join us in building a more connected and compassionate world, one neighborhood at a time.
